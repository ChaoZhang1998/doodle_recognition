# doodle_recognition

<u><em>doodle-recognition</em></u> is a simple tool that uses CNN to recognize drawings. The CNN was trained to recognize 100 classes using the quick draw <a href='https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset'> dataset</a>. It achieves 6% top 5 error. The accuracy could be improved but I focused on making the model light with around 1 million parameters. The table will show the top 5 predictions.
